# hello-world
My first repository

Learning to program using Java. 
Also interested in MySQL.
Will probably also need to learn HTML and CSS.

Eventually would like to create programs that accept user input, import data from delimited files, apply business logic and present information in the form of pivot tables and graphs, with interactive user selections.

I have used Excel Power Pivot with DAX, which is great for combining data, analyzing, and creating pivot tables and charts. But also need users to input data concurrently, and to have forms for user input. 

My company uses Windows exclusively. Even so, I'm learning to program on a Linux computer. Not sure yet if this is a mistake.
